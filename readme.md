Dotfiles
========
These are my dotfiles. I put them here mainly so I can easily access my
configuration from anywhere, but feel free to browse this for inspiration. I use
`stow` to deploy the dotfiles (when `stow` is available). I learnt about this in
[this post by Brandon Invergo][stowpost]. I use Git submodules to include Vim
plugins, which are managed by [Pathogen][pathogen]. The Pathogen script by Tim
Pope, licensed under the same terms as Vim, is included verbatim in this
repository.
